Every day, NASA features a different image of our fascinating universe. This site allows you to see a gallery of the most recent choices to see how diverse our universe is with descriptions written by professional astronomers!

## üíª Tech Used

 HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NASA APOD API, Netlify, Postman

## ‚úèÔ∏è My Approach

After reading the documentation provided by NASA, I started by planning out how I wanted to display the provided data. Per the documentation, to pull multiple images from their api, I could either get a count of random images or pull from a specific date range. I wanted to allow users to view the most recent submissions, so I decided to write some code to find the necessary date range based on the current date whenever a visitor comes to the site.

Once I finalized the functionality of the data pull, I was able to work on how I wanted to display the data. I went with a simple tiled photo gallery that covered the full screen to allow the user to see multiple images at the same time.

While working on the overall design of the site, I noticed the explanations provided from NASA could vary in length. This lead me to revise my original plan of having a small description box to instead be a scrollable frame to allow users to be able to read the full description, regardless of length.

## üìö Lessons Learned

I learned more about NASA's API, and how to write good documentation. I also got to dive more into Netlify's Functions for hiding API keys and proper usage.
